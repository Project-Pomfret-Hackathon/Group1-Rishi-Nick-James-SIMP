# MongoDB TypeScript API

## Use and Installation

1. Clone this repository,
2. Install dependencies via `npm install`
3. Run server with `npm run server` 

### MongoDB Connection

**The application will NOT connect to MongoDB successfully without you first adding in your Atlas URI.**

- Create an account and a server with MongoDB atlas cloud.
- Create a file in the root directory called `.env`, and add the following text: 
`ATLAS_URI:mongodb+srv://your_mogngodb_uri`

Do this BEFORE running the app for the first time.
